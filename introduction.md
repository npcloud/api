# What is NPCloud.io

NPCloud通过路径优化问题的计算交易，需求方在交易所发布问题，多个供应方通过竞争的方式
提供解答。需求方把算法设计的复杂性以及计算资源的需求都外包给了供应方，
供应方则可以在不暴露专利算法的情况下获得持续的收益。NPC Token是NPCloud委员会发行的token，作为NPCloud Exchange内交易的唯一结算货币，也用于交易双方支付交易所的手续费。

NPCloud is a ecosystem for distributed optimization algorithm computation.
The ecosystem's target is to provide efficient, accurate and fast access of
wide variety of optimization algorithm as a service. To achieve this, NPCloud
will need contributors and players like you.

NPCloud's basic idea is to let algorithm' users, whoever need to calculate
result of certain optimization problem, to buy optimization result from
 one or more algorithm providers. Both algorithm users and providers connect with algorithm
 exchange, and exchange provides API on problem listing, optimization result
 delivery.


 NPC token is used in NPCloud ecosystem as a value transfer tool. NPC token
 is created with a fixed amount supply and will be given distributed to
 partner in NPCloud ecosystem to support development and research.
