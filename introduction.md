# What is NPCloud.io

NPCloud is a ecosystem for distributed optimization algorithm computation.
The ecosystem's target is to provide efficient, accurate and fast access of
wide variety of optimization algorithm as a service. To achieve this, NPCloud
will need contributors and players like you.

NPCloud's basic idea is to let algorithm' users, whoever need to calculate
result of certain optimization problem, to buy optimization result from
 one or more algorithm providers. Both algorithm users and providers connect with algorithm
 exchange, and exchange provides API on problem listing, optimization result
 delivery.


 NPC token is used in NPCloud ecosystem as a value transfer tool. NPC token
 is created with a fixed amount supply and will be  distributed to
 partner in NPCloud ecosystem to support development and research.
